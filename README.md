## About

This project is a ficticious product reservation page for bicycle rentals. The main objectives of the project are:
* Create a simple front-end only rental website
* Include a complete checkout process, which means users should be able to select the type of product, select the number of product, view a summary before checkout, and in the end, check out. (Since the project is only front-end development, no actual payment would be processed)
* Users cannot check out with accessories or add-ons only - they must come with a bike selection.
* The content displayed should be responsive for mobile and desktop.
